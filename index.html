    <div class="rule">
      1. Start the Game: The game will display a message "Press A Key to Start".
      Press any key to begin.<br />
      <br />2. Remember the Sequence: The game will show a sequence of colors by
      lighting up the corresponding buttons.<br />
      <br />3. Repeat the Sequence: After the sequence is displayed, it's your
      turn to repeat it. Click on the buttons in the same order as shown.<br />
      <br />4. Advance to the Next Level: If you successfully repeat the
      sequence, the game will advance to the next level, adding a new color to
      the sequence.<br />
      <br />5. Keep Playing: Continue to repeat the sequences as they become
      longer and more challenging.<br />
      <br />6. Game Over: If you make a mistake in repeating the sequence, the
      game will end, and you'll have to start over.<br />
